# Interactive particles text create with three.js 
Here are the main steps we follow here:

We load the font and text that we want to animate.
We generate letter shapes from the font and place them on the stage.
We create particles for each point on the letter shapes.
We animate particles in response to mouse movement and mouse button presses.
We visualize text and particles on the stage.
This creates an interesting effect that can be used to create interactive visual representations of text on websites or web applications.
